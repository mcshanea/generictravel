Adrian,

Thanks for your time and I thought it was all looking good. As discussed
points to amend:

- Automatically generated booking numbers
- Ability to produce an invoice
- Administer a group leader for each booking
- Notes on a client
- Add up cost of services and then ability to mark up by percentage and only
have sale price visible
- Details of hotels and fixed departure trips to be supplied by me
- Change booking summary to show name, month of travel, booking number,
agent
- Add month of travel to booking

Is there a way to put the bookings into a calendar?

Hope this all makes sense, just rushing around trying to catch up on
yesterday but will try and get the stuff I am sending to you over asap.

Cheers,


Will
